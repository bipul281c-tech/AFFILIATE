## Aarika Girl's Cotton Kurti: Detailed Features

Yeh kurti sirf dikhne mein hi nahi, practical bhi hai. Let's dive into the details:

### Fabric & Comfort

Sabse pehle, fabric ki baat karte hain. It's made of cotton, jo ki bachchon ke liye best hai. Indian summers mein cotton se zyada *comfortable* kuch nahi hota. *Skin-friendly* material hai, toh rashes ya irritation ka tension nahi. Maine personally check kiya, toh fabric kaafi *breathable* laga.

### Design & Fit

Kurti ka design simple lekin elegant hai. It has a round neck and 3/4th sleeves, which is perfect for kids. Embellishments hain, but they are not too flashy. Regular fit hai, so bachchi aaram se khel-kood sakti hai. Stitching quality bhi *kaafi sturdy hai*.

### Size & Fit Guide

This kurti is available for age groups 9-10 Years, 10-11 Years, 12-13 Years, 14-15 Years, and 15-16 Years. I would recommend checking the size chart on *Amazon India* before ordering. Generally, it's *true to size*, but agar aapko thoda loose fit chahiye, toh *size up* kar sakte hain.
