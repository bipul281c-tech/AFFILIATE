The kurta has a straight cut, which is universally flattering. The floral print is delicate and not too overpowering. Stitching quality bhi kaafi achi hai, especially considering the price point. It's a short kurta, so it's perfect for pairing with jeans, leggings, or even palazzos.

They have a size chart available, toh before you order, please check your measurements. From what I can tell from the reviews, it seems pretty true to size. If you want a more relaxed fit, maybe size up ek size. But definitely refer to the size chart provided on Amazon India!
