## Alvami Women Kurta Set: Detailed Features

This kurta set is a complete package, aur woh bhi under ₹1000! Let's dive into what makes it special.

### Fabric & Comfort

The Alvami kurta set is made from Viscose fabric. Viscose, as you know, is known for its softness and breathability. Indian summers ke liye toh yeh bilkul perfect hai! It feels skin-friendly and non-itchy, jo ki bahut important hai. Pure din pehen kar bhi aaram milega.

### Design & Fit

This is a straight kurta set with a 3/4 sleeve, which is a classic and flattering style. The print is quite elegant, and the stitching looks kaafi sturdy hai. They offer it in many colors such as Black, Blue and Red. The set includes a kurta, pant, and dupatta, so you don't have to worry about matching anything.

## Styling Tips / Kaise Style Karein?

The best part about this kurta set is its versatility. You can style it in so many ways!

### Occasion 1: Office/College

For a simple office or college look, pair the kurta set with minimal jewelry, like small earrings or a simple pendant. Flats or comfortable sandals would be ideal. Keep the dupatta neatly draped on one shoulder. A tote bag would complete the look.

### Occasion 2: Festive/Party

For a festive or party look, dress it up with heavy jhumkas, a statement necklace, and high heels. Experiment with dupatta draping styles – you can try pleating it and pinning it on one side or letting it flow freely. A clutch or small embellished bag would be perfect.
