## Detailed Features: ANNI DESIGNER Kurta Set Deep Dive

Let's break down why this kurta set is such a steal.

### Fabric & Comfort: Rayon Viscose

The kurta set is made from Rayon Viscose (Rayon Viscose 100%). Ab, rayon viscose kaafi comfortable hota hai, especially for Indian summers. It's lightweight and breathable, so you won't feel like you're suffocating in the heat. Plus, it's skin-friendly, so no itchy feeling all day long. Believe me, comfort is key, especially when you're running around during festivals or just chilling with friends.

### Design & Fit: Straight Style with Floral Print

The kurta has a straight style with a calf-length cut, which is super versatile. You can wear it to the office, college, or even a small get-together. The floral print is subtle but adds a touch of elegance. The round V-neck is also quite flattering. Stitching quality bhi theek-thaak hai, considering the price.

### Size & Fit Guide: Choose Wisely

Size chart is mentioned, so measure yourself carefully before ordering. Kurta sizes range from S-36 in to XXL-44 in, while pant sizes range from S-28 in to XXL-36 in. Generally, it seems true to size, but if you prefer a more relaxed fit, consider sizing up. Remember, it’s always better to have a little extra room than feeling too constricted.
