## Aarika Girl's Cotton Kurti: Detailed Features

Let's dig a little deeper into what makes this kurti a potential *paisa vasool* deal.

### Fabric & Comfort

Yeh kurti cotton se bani hai, which is a big plus point. Indian summers mein, cotton is king! Skin-friendly material hai, so no worries about itchy or uncomfortable fabric, especially for your little one's sensitive skin. It's breathable, which means she can wear it all day without feeling suffocated. *Online shopping India* mein, especially when buying clothes, fabric is something you really have to pay attention to.

### Design & Fit

The kurti has a regular fit, which is perfect for everyday wear. It's not too tight, not too loose – just right for playing and running around. The embellishments add a touch of festive flair without being too over-the-top. The 3/4th sleeves are also a practical choice, giving her freedom of movement. Round neck design hai jo comfortable rahega.

### Size & Fit Guide

The Aarika Kurti is available for girls aged 9-10 years, 10-11 years, 12-13 years, 14-15 years, and 15-16 years. I would say it's pretty true to size, but if you're unsure, size up for a more comfortable fit, especially if your child is between sizes.
