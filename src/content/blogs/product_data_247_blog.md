## Detailed Features of this Budget-Friendly Kurta

Okay, so let's talk details.  Yeh kurta hai Yash Gallery ka, and it’s a regular fit short kurta with a floral print.  First impressions?  It looks kaafi cute and comfortable.

### Fabric & Comfort

The kurta is made of cotton, which is a big plus, especially for Indian summers.  Cotton is super breathable, skin-friendly, and non-itchy.  You can wear it all day without feeling uncomfortable.  Maine personally check kiya toh fabric kaafi soft laga.  It's perfect for those days when you just want to relax and feel good.  Plus, cotton is easy to maintain – more on that later!

### Design & Fit

The design is a simple empire style with a round neck and 3/4 sleeves.  The floral print is what makes it stand out. It's not too loud, but definitely adds a touch of elegance.  The stitching quality seems decent for the price.  It's a short kurta, so it ends above the knees, making it perfect to pair with leggings, jeans, or even palazzos.

### Size & Fit Guide

Now, sizing can be tricky with online shopping India.  The product description says to check your measurements before ordering, which is always a good idea.  Go through the size chart carefully.  From the reviews, it seems like it’s mostly true to size, but if you prefer a more relaxed fit, you might want to size up for comfort.
