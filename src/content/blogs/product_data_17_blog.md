## Detailed Features of this Jaipuri Cotton Kurti

Let's dive into why I think this kurti is a steal, especially at this best price.

### Fabric & Comfort

Yeh kurti 100% cotton se bani hai, which means it's super breathable – important for those Indian summers! The product description says it's pre-shrunk cotton, which is a huge plus point. Koi tension nahi hogi dhone ke baad shrink hone ki. Aur toh aur, it's lightweight and soft to the skin. Imagine, garmi mein bhi sukoon! It’s designed to be non-itchy, so you can wear it all day long without any discomfort.

### Design & Fit

The Jaipuri print is what really caught my eye. It's traditional, vibrant, and adds a pop of color without being too loud. The short kurti style makes it versatile – you can pair it with jeans, leggings, or even a skirt. The stitching quality looks decent from the pictures, and the cut seems flattering.

### Size & Fit Guide

They’ve given a detailed size chart, which is super helpful. Basically, XS fits upto bust 32 inches, S fits upto 34 inches, M upto 36, L upto 38, XL upto 40, 2XL upto 42 and 3XL fits upto 44 inches. My suggestion? Measure yourself before ordering. It seems pretty true to size, but if you prefer a looser fit, maybe size up for comfort.
