### Fabric & Comfort

The product material is Viscose. Viscose feels kaafi soft hai against the skin, making it comfortable for long hours, even in Indian summers. It's breathable, so you won't feel suffocated, even if you're dancing at a wedding! Plus, it drapes really well, adding to the overall elegance of the Anarkali. I'd say it's pretty skin-friendly, and shouldn't cause any itching or irritation.

### Design & Fit

The kurta features a beautiful Anarkali print design. The blue colour is vibrant and festive. The stitching quality looks good in the pictures, and with 742 ratings, it seems like other buyers agree too. The 3/4 sleeves are a classic Indian style, perfect for showing off your bangles. The pant is a straight style, which balances out the flared Anarkali kurta nicely. Aur dupatta? It's made of Chanderi cotton, which is lightweight and adds a touch of elegance.

### Size & Fit Guide

According to the product details, all regular sizes are available (S, M, L, XL, XXL). I'd recommend checking the size chart on the Amazon India page before you order. Generally, with Anarkali suits, it's best to go true to size. If you're in between sizes, I'd suggest sizing up for extra comfort, especially if you plan on wearing it for long hours.
