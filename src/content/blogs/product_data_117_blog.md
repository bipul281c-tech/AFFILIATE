## Sidhidata Kurti: Detailed Features

Let's talk about the details, because that's where the magic happens. Yeh sirf ek aur kurti nahi hai; it's a complete look at an affordable price.

### Fabric & Comfort

The fabric is Rayon, and honestly, it feels kaafi soft. 100% Rayon hai, so it's breathable, which is super important for Indian summers. Imagine wearing something that doesn't irritate your skin, even when it's hot outside. This kurti is exactly that. It's skin-friendly aur lightweight bhi hai.

### Design & Fit

This is an A-Line kurti with a short length and 3/4 sleeves – perfect for a modern yet traditional look. The neck embroidery is the highlight; it adds a touch of elegance without being too over-the-top. The stitching quality bhi mujhe kaafi achi lagi. It's not flimsy at all; it feels kaafi sturdy hai.

### Size & Fit Guide

From what I can tell from the reviews and details, the sizing is pretty true to size. Agar aapko thoda loose fit pasand hai, toh maybe size up for comfort. But generally, apne normal size ke hisab se order karo.
