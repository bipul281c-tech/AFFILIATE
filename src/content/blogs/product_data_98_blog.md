I was looking for something budget-friendly aur decent for daily wear, and then I found this EthnicJunction kurti on Amazon India. Dekhte hi dil bola, "chal, try kar ke dekhte hain!".

**Detailed Features: Kyun Yeh Kurti Hai Itni Khaas?**

## Fabric & Comfort: Aaram Ki Guarantee?

Yeh kurti viscose rayon se bani hai. Now, viscose rayon feels almost like cotton – kaafi soft aur skin-friendly. Indian summers ke liye breathable bhi hai, toh chip-chip wali feeling nahi aayegi. Plus, maine pehen ke dekha, toh non-itchy bhi laga. Perfect for long office hours!

## Design & Fit: Look Bhi Toh Acha Hona Chahiye!

The kurti has an A-line cut, which is flattering for most body types. The rust color is quite unique, and the embroidery adds a touch of elegance. Stitching bhi kaafi neat hai, matlab durability kaafi sturdy hai. Round neck hai, so it's comfortable and easy to wear.

## Size & Fit Guide: Sizing Ka Kya Scene Hai?

According to the size chart, it seems pretty true to size. But, agar tumhe thoda loose fit pasand hai, toh ek size up le sakte ho. I ordered my usual size, and it fits perfectly. Make sure to check the size chart before ordering, though!
