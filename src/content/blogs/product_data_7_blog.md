## Detailed Features: Stylum Kurta – A Deep Dive

Let's break down what makes this kurta stand out.

### Fabric & Comfort

The kurta is made of rayon, which is known for being lightweight and breathable. Rayon *kaafi* soft *hota hai*, almost like silk, but without the hefty price tag. It's skin-friendly, making it perfect for Indian summers. Rayon allows air to flow, keeping you cool and comfortable, *bilkul bhi* itchy *nahi lagega*. It’s a good option for those who want something that feels light and airy.

### Design & Fit

This is an A-line kurta, which means it's fitted at the top and gradually widens towards the bottom. A-line kurtis are generally flattering for all body types. The pink floral print is vibrant and adds a touch of elegance. It features a mandarin collar and 3/4 sleeves, making it suitable for both casual and semi-formal occasions. The princess line cut with buttons on the front placket and lace embellishment adds a unique touch.

### Size & Fit Guide

While the product description doesn't explicitly mention whether it runs true to size, reading the reviews on Amazon India can give you a better idea. Generally, it's a good idea to check the size chart provided by Stylum and maybe size up if you prefer a looser fit.

## Styling Tips / Kaise Style Karein?

*Yeh kurta versatile hai*, so you can style it in many ways!
