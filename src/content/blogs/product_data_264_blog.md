## GoSriKi Kurta: Detailed Features

This GoSriKi Women's Cotton Blend Straight Fit Kurta is definitely budget-friendly, but does it deliver on style and comfort? Here's a breakdown:

### Fabric & Comfort

The kurta is made of a cotton blend. Ab, cotton blend hai toh 100% cotton jaisa nahi hoga, but it feels surprisingly soft against the skin. It’s breathable enough for Indian summers, which is a big plus. Garmi mein bhi aaram milega! It's not itchy at all, which is a relief.

### Design & Fit

The kurta has a straight cut, which is universally flattering. The black color is classic and versatile. The embroidery on the front and sleeves adds a touch of elegance without being too over-the-top. Simple but stylish! The round v-neck is also a nice touch. Stitching quality bhi theek-thaak hai, especially considering the price.

The kurta seems to be true to size. Agar aapko thoda loose fit pasand hai, toh maybe size up for comfort. But generally, your regular size should work just fine. Check the size chart on Amazon India before ordering, just to be sure.
