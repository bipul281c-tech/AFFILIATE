## Detailed Features: Myx Kurti - Closer Look

This Myx Women Cotton Short Kurti is perfect for everyday wear. Let's dive into the details:

### Fabric & Comfort - Garmi Ke Liye Perfect!

The kurti is made of pure cotton cambric.  *Garmi* ke liye toh ekdum best!  It's non-sheer, so no need to worry about layering.  They've also given it a special softener finish, which makes it feel really smooth against the skin. *Skin-friendly* and *breathable* – exactly what you need in the Indian summers.  It feels *non-itchy*, unlike some other cottons I've tried.

### Design & Fit - Simple Yet Stylish

It's a regular fit, short kurti with a screen-printed design. The *samosa lace* detailing at the front yoke adds a touch of ethnic charm.  It has a band collar with a half placket and 3/4th sleeves with a roll-tab cuff.  The stitching quality looks *kaafi sturdy hai*, which is important for long-lasting wear.

### Size & Fit Guide - Apna Size Dhundo!

Make sure you check the size chart before ordering! They've provided a detailed size and fit guide in the 5th image of the product catalogue. I'd say it's pretty *true to size*, but if you prefer a more relaxed fit, maybe *size up for comfort*.
