## Stylum Kurta: Detailed Features

This kurta immediately caught my eye. The pink floral print is so cheerful, perfect for festive wear India or even a casual day out. Let's dive into the details:

### Fabric & Comfort

The kurta is made of rayon, which is known for being lightweight and breathable. Garmi ke liye toh ekdum perfect! Rayon feels soft against the skin, so it's comfortable even if you wear it for long hours. Yeh skin-friendly material hai, toh itching ki koi tension nahi.

### Design & Fit

It's an A-line kurta, which is a flattering cut for most body types. The princess line design gives it a slightly more structured look than a regular kurta. The buttons on the front placket and lace embellishment add a touch of elegance. Stitching bhi kaafi neat hai, which is important. The mandarin collar gives it a modern touch.

### Size & Fit Guide

Based on the reviews, it seems like the kurta is true to size. If you prefer a looser fit, especially during the summer months, you might want to size up. Check the size chart on Amazon India before you order, just to be sure.

## Kaise Style Karein? Styling Tips

The best part about this kurta is its versatility. You can style it in so many different ways!

### Office/College Look

For a simple and elegant office or college look, pair the kurta with white or beige leggings. Keep the jewelry minimal – maybe just small earrings or a delicate pendant. Flats or simple sandals would complete the look. A tote bag will be perfect to carry all your essentials.

### Festive/Party Look

For a festive or party look, you can dress up the kurta with heavy jhumkas and a statement necklace. A bright dupatta with some embroidery would add a pop of color. Heels or embellished juttis would look great. Don't forget a clutch or a small potli bag.
