## Aahwan Kurti Top: Detailed Features

Ab zara is kurti ke features ko thoda deep dive karte hain. After all, sirf dekhne mein achi nahi honi chahiye, pehenne mein bhi comfortable honi chahiye!

### Fabric & Comfort

The Aahwan Kurti Top is made of polyester. Although it's not cotton, the material feels surprisingly skin-friendly. Garmi ke liye breathable toh rahega, I hope! Polyester usually dries quickly, which is a plus point. Dekhna padega ki yeh non-itchy hai ya nahi, but overall, for the price, the fabric seems decent.

### Design & Fit

The design is definitely eye-catching. It has a square neck and a backless design which makes it perfect for party wear. The printed pattern adds a touch of elegance, and the ruched bust with tie-back closure gives it a modern Indo-Western look. Fit & flare style hai, so it should flatter most body types. Stitching quality dekhni padegi, but from the pictures, it looks reasonably well-made.

### Size & Fit Guide

The product description says the model (5'7") is wearing a size S. Fit Type is mentioned as Slim Fit. So, agar aapko thoda loose fit pasand hai, toh size up karna better rahega. Check the size chart carefully on Amazon India before ordering to avoid any size issues.

## Styling Tips / Kaise Style Karein?

Yeh kurti versatile hai, so you can style it in multiple ways!

### Occasion 1: Office/College

For a simple office or college look, pair this kurti with high-waisted jeans or a solid-colored skirt. Keep the jewelry minimal – just a pair of small earrings. Flats or simple sandals will complete the look. You can also add a light shrug or jacket if it gets chilly.

### Occasion 2: Festive/Party

To dress it up for a festive occasion or a party, go for heavy jhumkas and a statement necklace. Heels will definitely elevate the look. You can also drape a contrasting dupatta to add a traditional touch. A clutch or a small sling bag will be perfect to carry your essentials.
