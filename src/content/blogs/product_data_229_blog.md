## Detailed Features: Hritika Women's Cotton Kurta

Yeh kurta sirf sasta nahi hai, isme features bhi kaafi ache hain. Let's dive in:

### Fabric & Comfort

The kurta is made of blended cotton. Garmi ke liye *kaafi* breathable rahega. It feels skin-friendly, and I don't think it will be itchy at all, which is a big plus in the Indian heat. Cotton kurtis are always a good choice for comfort.

### Design & Fit

The kurta has a straight cut with side slits. Solid plain strips effect with golden shimmer is adding a subtle touch of elegance, making it perfect for both casual and festive occasions. Boat neck design is modern and stylish. Stitching quality *kaafi* fine lag rahi hai photos mein.

## Styling Tips / Kaise Style Karein?

Yeh kurta *kaafi* versatile hai. Yahan kuch ideas hain:
