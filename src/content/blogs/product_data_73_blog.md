## Rajnandini Kurti: A Detailed Look at This Affordable Find

This kurti is perfect for those looking for comfortable and stylish ethnic wear online in India without breaking the bank. Let's dive into the details.

### Fabric & Comfort

The kurti is made from Khadi Cotton Blended fabric. Ab, khadi cotton ka naam sunte hi ek sukoon milta hai, right? It's known for being skin-friendly and breathable, especially for Indian summers. Yeh non-itchy bhi hai, so you can wear it all day long without any discomfort. Imagine, garmi mein bhi aaram!

### Design & Fit

The A-line cut is super flattering for all body types. It's relaxed fit, so you won't feel restricted. The Jaipuri print is classic and adds a touch of elegance. Stitching quality bhi kaafi achi hai, considering the price point. The all-over Jaipuri printed design is very appealing and festive.

Rajnandini offers this kurti in normal sizes (S, M, L, XL, 2XL) and plus sizes (2XL, 3XL, 4XL, 5XL, 6XL). Generally, it's true to size, but if you prefer a looser fit, you might want to size up for comfort. Check the size chart on Amazon India before ordering to be sure.
