## Rytras Floral Top: A Detailed Look

This Rytras top promises comfort and style without breaking the bank. But does it deliver? Let's dive into the details.

### Fabric & Comfort: Garmiyon ke liye Perfect?

The top is made of cotton, which is a big plus point, especially for Indian summers. Cotton is breathable, so paseena nahi aayega and it's generally skin-friendly. I've read reviews saying the fabric is kaafi soft, but kuch logon ne kaha it can be a little sheer. So, maybe wear a camisole inside.

### Design & Fit: Simple Yet Stylish

The floral print is pretty and not too loud. It's a white and orange combination, which is quite refreshing. The mandarin collar gives it a slightly formal look, so you can wear it to college or even a casual office setting. Stitching quality wise, it looks decent for the price. The fit is regular, so it shouldn't be too tight or too loose.

### Size & Fit Guide: Apne Size ka Chuno

Most reviews suggest that the top is true to size. However, if you prefer a looser fit, especially in the chest area, you might want to size up. Always check the size chart on Amazon India before ordering!

### Office/College Look: Keep it Simple

For a simple office or college look, pair the top with dark wash jeans or black trousers. Add some simple stud earrings and flats or loafers. A tote bag would complete the look. Keep the makeup minimal – just some lip balm and eyeliner.
