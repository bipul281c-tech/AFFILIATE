Generally, reviews suggest that the kurta is true to size. However, if you prefer a looser, more comfortable fit, especially for those long festive days, consider sizing up. Check the size chart on Amazon India before you buy online India, just to be sure.

## Styling Tips / Kaise Style Karein?

So, you've got the kurta. Now, how to style it? Here are a couple of ideas:

### Office/College Look: Simple and Chic

For a simple office or college look, pair this kurta with ankle leggings or straight pants. Keep the jewelry minimal – maybe just small earrings. Flats or simple sandals would complete the look. A simple tote bag will be perfect to carry your essentials.

### Festive/Party Look: Dhamakedar!

For a festive or party look, go all out! Wear it with heavy jhumkas, high heels, and a contrasting dupatta. You can also experiment with different dupatta draping styles to add a unique touch. Think Kolhapuris or embellished juttis for footwear. A potli bag would look amazing.
