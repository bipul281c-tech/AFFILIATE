### Fabric & Comfort: *Ek Dum Mast!*

The kurta is made of silk blend, which feels really nice against the skin. It's not *that* heavy silk that makes you sweat. It’s *kaafi* breathable for Indian summers. *Plus*, the Chinnon silk pant is *ek dum* comfortable. The fabric feels skin-friendly and non-itchy.

### Design & Fit: *Style Mein Number One!*

The straight cut is classic and suits almost every body type. The embroidery work is delicate and adds a touch of elegance. The stitching *bhi kaafi* neat hai, *toh* overall, it looks pretty good for the price.

### Size & Fit Guide: *Perfect Size Kaise Chune?*

According to the details, the kurta length is 45 inches, and the sleeves are 17 inches. The bust size is 36 inches. The pant waist is 27 inches, and the pant length is 37.5 inches with a hip of 40 inches.

## Kaise Style Karein? *Let's Get Styling!*

Yeh kurta set *versatile* hai, *yaar*. You can style it in so many ways!

### Office/College Look

For a simple office or college look, pair it with minimal jewelry – maybe just small earrings. Go for flats or simple sandals. Keep the dupatta neatly draped on one shoulder. A simple tote bag will complete the look.

### Festive/Party Look

For a festive occasion, go all out! Wear heavy jhumkas, bangles, and a statement necklace. Heels will add to the elegance. Experiment with different dupatta draping styles – maybe a traditional Gujarati drape or a modern front drape. *Ek clutch* or a small embellished bag will be perfect.
