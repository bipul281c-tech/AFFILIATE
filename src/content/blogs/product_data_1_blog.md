### Design & Fit

This is a 3-piece set:
*   **Kurta**: Calf-length A-line kurta with an embroidered yoke. The embroidery is delicate and adds a festive touch without being too over-the-top.  3/4th sleeves are always a plus in Indian weather!
*   **Pyjama**: Straight-fit pyjama with a pocket!  Pocket is so important, especially when you don't want to carry a bag. Skin-friendly elastic waist bhi hai for added comfort.
*   **Dupatta**: Printed organza dupatta finished with scallop edge zari Dori embroidery. The printed organza dupatta is the highlight – it's lightweight and adds a touch of sophistication. Zari Dori embroidery gives it a *desi* vibe.

The A-line fit is flattering for most body types. Stitching quality bhi high quality hai, so you know it will last.

### Size & Fit Guide

Make sure to check the size chart (5th image in the catalogue) before ordering. Generally, *true to size* hai, but agar aapko thoda loose fit pasand hai, toh *size up for comfort*.
