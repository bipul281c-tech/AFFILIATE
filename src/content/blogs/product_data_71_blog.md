## Detailed Features: FABNEX Kurta Set (K-71-118)

### Fabric & Comfort

The FABNEX kurta set is made from a "Cotton Bland" fabric. Ab "Cotton Bland" exactly kya hai, you might ask? Well, it's likely a cotton blend. While the description could be clearer, cotton blends generally offer the breathability of cotton with added durability and wrinkle-resistance from other fibers. Yeh fabric Indian summers ke liye kaafi comfortable rahega, and it should be fairly skin-friendly bhi. Just keep in mind that the exact feel will depend on the specific blend.

### Design & Fit

The kurta has a regular fit, which is perfect for everyday comfort. It's a simple, straight-cut design. The product description mentions it's a three-piece set including a kurta, pant, and dupatta. The images show various prints and colors are available. Stitching quality dekhne mein toh achi lag rahi hai in the pictures, but of course, you'll know better once you have it in hand.

### Size & Fit Guide

Since the fit type is regular, I'd say it's probably true to size. However, if you prefer a looser, more comfortable fit, especially for those long festive days, consider sizing up. Check the size chart on Amazon India before ordering to be sure!

## Styling Tips / Kaise Style Karein?

This kurta set is super versatile! Yahan kuch ideas hain:

### Occasion 1: Office/College

For a simple office or college look, pair the kurta with minimal jewelry, like small stud earrings and a simple bracelet. Flats or comfortable sandals would be perfect. Keep the dupatta neatly draped on one shoulder. A simple tote bag will complete the look.

### Occasion 2: Festive/Party

To dress it up for a festive occasion or party, go for heavier jhumkas or chandbali earrings. Add some bangles or a statement ring. Heels or embellished juttis would elevate the look. Experiment with different dupatta draping styles – try pleating it and pinning it on one shoulder, or letting it flow freely. A small clutch or potli bag would be a great addition.

### Footwear

Depending on the occasion, you can pair this kurta set with Kolhapuris, Juttis, or Heels. Kolhapuris are great for a traditional and comfortable look. Juttis add a touch of elegance, while heels can dress up the outfit for a party.

### Accessories

Accessorize with oxidized silver jewelry for a boho-chic vibe, or go for gold jewelry for a more traditional look. A colorful bindi can also add a festive touch. Don't forget a stylish bag to complete your ensemble!

## Care Instructions / Kapde Ki Dekhbhale

Since the fabric is a cotton blend, here are some tips to keep your kurta set looking its best:

*   **Washing:** Machine wash in cold water on a gentle cycle. Avoid using bleach.
*   **Drying:** Tumble dry on low heat or, even better, air dry to prevent shrinkage. Don't dry in direct sunlight, as it can fade the colors.
*   **Ironing:** Iron on a low to medium setting. If the fabric is delicate, use a pressing cloth.
