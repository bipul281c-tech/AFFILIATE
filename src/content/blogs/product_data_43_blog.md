### Fabric & Comfort

The GoSriKi kurta set is made from Rayon Viscose (100%). Iska matlab hai ki yeh fabric kaafi *breathable* hai, especially for Indian summers. Maine personally rayon viscose pehna hai, and I can vouch for its comfort. Yeh skin-friendly bhi hai, so you don't have to worry about any irritation.

### Design & Fit

This kurta set features an A-line kurta, which is a classic silhouette. A-line kurta kaafi *flattering* hota hai, kyunki yeh body ko nicely drape karta hai. The solid color makes it easy to pair with different accessories. Stitching quality bhi kaafi achi dikh rahi hai images mein. The V-neck design adds a touch of elegance.
