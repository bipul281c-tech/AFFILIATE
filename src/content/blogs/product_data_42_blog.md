### Design & Fit: Look Stylish, Feel Great

Is kurti ka style straight hai with a side slit, jo ise modern touch deta hai. The calf length is perfect for both casual and office wear. Elbow sleeves are comfortable and stylish. Aur jo Shibori print hai, woh isko ek unique look deta hai. Stitching quality bhi achi hai, so it will last long.

## Styling Tips / Kaise Style Karein?

## Care Instructions / Kapde Ki Dekhbhale

Chanderi fabric delicate hota hai, so take extra care:

*   **Washing**: Dry clean is preferred. If hand washing, use cold water and a mild detergent. Avoid rubbing the fabric vigorously.
*   **Drying**: Don't dry in direct sunlight. Dry inside out in oblique sunlight to prevent color fading.
*   **Ironing**: Use a low-temperature setting and place a thin cotton cloth over the saree while ironing. Steam ironing works wonders for stubborn creases.
*   **Storage**: Keep your Chanderi saree in a cotton or muslin cloth to let it breathe. Store it in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight to prevent discoloration.
