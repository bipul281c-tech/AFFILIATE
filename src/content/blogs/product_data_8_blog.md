## Detailed Features: Dekhne Mein Bhi Sundar, Pehenne Mein Bhi Aaramdayak

### Fabric & Comfort
Yeh kurta rayon fabric se bana hai. Rayon is known for being lightweight and breathable, especially for Indian summers. It feels soft against the skin, and it drapes well, giving a nice flowy look. Maine suna hai ki rayon thoda delicate hota hai, but agar dhang se care karo toh kaafi sturdy hai.

### Design & Fit
The kurta has a flattering A-line cut, which looks good on almost every body type. It has a mandarin collar and 3/4 sleeves, which gives it a very elegant and sophisticated look. Front placket mein buttons hain aur lace embellishment bhi hai, adding a touch of detail. The floral print is subtle and not too overpowering, making it perfect for everyday wear.

### Size & Fit Guide
According to some reviews, it’s best to size up for comfort. Check the size chart on Amazon India carefully before ordering. Kyunki baad mein return karna isse acha hai pehle hi sahi size order karo!
