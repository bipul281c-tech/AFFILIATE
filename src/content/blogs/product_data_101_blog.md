### Fabric & Comfort: "Makhan" Jaisa Soft!

Yeh kurti viscose rayon se bani hai, which means it's super *skin-friendly*. Indian summers mein, you need something *breathable*, aur yeh kurti wohi hai. It's not itchy at all, aur pehen kar lagta hai jaise kuch pehna hi nahi hai! Seriously, it feels like *makhan* on your skin.

### Design & Fit: A-Line Jo Sabko Suit Kare!

The A-line cut is universally flattering. It gently flares out from the bust, hiding any problem areas around the hips. The embroidery is delicate and adds a touch of sophistication without being too over-the-top. Stitching bhi kaafi sturdy hai, toh you know it will last.

### Size & Fit Guide: Perfect Size Kaise Chune?

According to the size chart, it seems pretty true to size. If you prefer a more relaxed fit, especially for office wear, I'd suggest sizing up one size. Check the size chart carefully before ordering!

## Styling Tips / Kaise Style Karein?

This kurti is so versatile! You can style it in so many ways:

### Occasion 1: Office/College - Simple and Chic

For a simple office look, pair this kurti with your favorite jeans or cotton leggings. Keep the jewelry minimal - just some small earrings. Flats or comfortable sandals would be perfect. You can also add a light cotton scarf for a pop of color.

### Occasion 2: Festive/Party - Dress it Up!

For a festive occasion, you can dress it up with some heavy *jhumkas* and a statement necklace. Heels or *juttis* would look great. You can also add a *dupatta* with some shimmer or embroidery for a more festive look.

## Care Instructions / Kapde Ki Dekhbhale

Viscose rayon needs a little extra care to keep it looking its best:

*   Use a mild detergent.
*   Don't wring it out! Gently squeeze out the excess water.
*   **Don't dry in direct sunlight**, as this can cause the color to fade.
