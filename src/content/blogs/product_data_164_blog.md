## Fabric & Comfort: Pure Sukoon!

The best part about this Pistaa's kurti is the fabric. It's made of viscose, which is super skin-friendly. Imagine, *garmi ke mausam* mein bhi *thanda thanda cool cool* feel hoga! Viscose is known for being breathable, so you won't feel suffocated, unlike some synthetic fabrics. Plus, the interlock stitching ensures that it's *kaafi* sturdy *hai*, and won't tear easily.

## Design & Fit: Perfect for Every Body Type

Yeh kurti relaxed fit mein aati hai, which means it's not too tight or too loose. It's just right! The straight cut and mandarin collar give it a very sophisticated look, perfect for both office and casual outings. And the printed pattern? *Hayee, kya bataun*! It's subtle yet stylish, adding a touch of elegance without being too loud. The fold-up sleeves are a great feature too – you can adjust them according to your mood and the weather.
