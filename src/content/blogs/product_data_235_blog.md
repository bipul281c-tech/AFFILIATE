The design is simple yet elegant. The floral motifs and paisley designs add a touch of grace without being too loud. *Online shopping India* can be tricky with sizing, but this set seems to be true to size according to most reviews.

Most reviewers say it's "True to size." However, if you prefer a looser fit, especially during summers, consider sizing up for extra comfort. Check the size chart on *Amazon India* carefully before you *order online.* Also, keep in mind that after the first wash cotton can shrink a little.
