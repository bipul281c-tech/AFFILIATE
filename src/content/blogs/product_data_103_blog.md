## Detailed Features: Pistaa Kurta - A Deep Dive

Let's get into the details of this Pistaa kurta, because it's more than just a pretty print.

### Fabric & Comfort

This kurta is made of pure cotton. Garmi ke liye *ekdum* perfect! It's super comfortable and breathable, which is essential for Indian summers. The material feels skin-friendly; it's non-itchy, which is a big plus for me because I have sensitive skin. The interlock stitching also means it's *kaafi* sturdy hai, so you know it won't fall apart after a few washes.

### Design & Fit

The A-line cut is super flattering for all body types. It's relaxed fit, so it's not too clingy. The floral print is subtle and elegant – not too loud, which I appreciate. The 3/4th sleeves are practical, and the round collar style is classic. The floral motifs with crochet trims add a touch of elegance. The kurti length is 46 inches, which is a good length for me.

### Size & Fit Guide

It's important to get the right size, *hai na*? According to the size chart, X-Small is 36 inches, Small is 38 inches, Medium is 40 inches, Large is 42 inches, XL is 44 inches, XXL is 46 inches, XXXL is 48 inches, and XXXXL is 50 inches. I would say it's pretty true to size. If you're in between sizes, maybe size up for extra comfort. Always check the size chart *before* ordering!
