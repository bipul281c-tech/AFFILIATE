## Fabric & Comfort: Chanderi Magic

The kurti is made of chanderi, which is known for being lightweight and slightly sheer. Garmiyon ke liye perfect hai! It's not super soft like cotton, but it's definitely *skin-friendly* and *breathable for Indian summers*. Just remember that because of the nature of the fabric, it might need a lining if you prefer more coverage.

## Design & Fit: Straight and Stylish

The straight cut with a front split is very in these days. It’s a classic silhouette that looks good on almost everyone. The floral print is delicate and adds a touch of femininity. The puff sleeves are a cute detail without being too over-the-top. The stitching looks *kaafi* decent for the price.

## Size & Fit Guide: XL Details

Okay, so this particular kurta is an XL. Here are the measurements:

*   Bust Size: 42 inches
*   Shoulder size: 15.5 inches
*   Waist size: 39 inches
*   Hip size: 44 inches

Make sure you measure yourself before ordering! If you are between sizes, I would suggest you *size up for comfort*.

## Styling Tips / *Kaise Style Karein?*

This kurta is super versatile, *yaar*!

### Occasion 1: Office/College

For a simple, everyday look, pair this kurta with leggings or straight pants. Keep the jewelry minimal – small earrings and a simple bracelet will do. Flat sandals or *juttis* would be ideal. A tote bag will complete the look.

### Occasion 2: Festive/Party

To dress it up for a festive occasion, go for some heavy *jhumkas*, a statement necklace, and bangles. Heels or embellished *juttis* will elevate the look. You can experiment with different dupatta draping styles to add some drama. A clutch or small sling bag would be perfect.

## Care Instructions / *Kapde Ki Dekhbhale*

Chanderi is a delicate fabric, so proper care is essential to make it last longer.

*   **Washing:** Hand wash gently in cold water with a mild detergent. Avoid machine washing if possible. If machine washing, use a delicate cycle and place the kurta in a mesh laundry bag.
*   **Drying:** Do not wring or twist the fabric. Air dry inside-out in the shade. *Don't dry in direct sunlight*, as it can fade the colors.
*   **Ironing:** Use a low heat setting and iron on the reverse side of the fabric. You can also place a thin cotton cloth between the iron and the kurta.
*   **Storage:** Store the kurta in a cotton or muslin cloth bag to protect it from dust and moisture.
