## Styling Tips / Kaise Style Karein?

So, you've got the kurta set. Now, let’s talk about how to style it for different occasions!

### Occasion 1: Office/College

For a simple office or college look, pair the kurta set with minimal jewelry. Think small earrings and a simple bracelet. Flats or comfortable sandals would be perfect. Keep the dupatta draped simply over your shoulder. You can also try wearing the kurta separately with jeans for a more casual vibe.

### Occasion 2: Festive/Party

For a festive or party look, dress it up with heavy jhumkas and statement jewelry. Heels would elevate the outfit. Experiment with different dupatta draping styles – try pleating it and pinning it on one shoulder, or letting it flow freely. A clutch or small potli bag would complete the look.
