## Detailed Features: Ek Dum Jhakaas!

Okay, let's dive into the details of this top.

### Fabric & Comfort

The top is made of "Rayon," which, sach bataun toh, isn't cotton as the title suggests. But don't worry! Rayon can be *kaafi* breathable and comfortable, especially for Indian weather. It drapes well and feels soft against the skin. It’s lightweight, so you won't feel weighed down, even if you're running errands all day. This makes it a good choice for the humid climate in India.

### Design & Fit

The style is "Peplum," which means it's fitted at the top and flares out at the waist. This can be super flattering for many body types. The "Embroidered" pattern adds a touch of elegance without being too over-the-top. The grey color is versatile, making it easy to pair with different bottoms. The patchwork details give it a unique, ethnic vibe. Stitching quality *kaafi* important hai, and from the pictures, it looks neatly done.

### Size & Fit Guide

The product description mentions checking your measurements before ordering. This is crucial! Sizes can vary, so grab a measuring tape and compare your measurements to their size chart. From the reviews, it seems like it runs "true to size," but if you prefer a looser fit, consider sizing up.

## Styling Tips / Kaise Style Karein?

This top is super versatile! Here are a couple of ways you can style it:

### Occasion 1: Office/College

For a simple and chic office or college look, pair this top with dark wash jeans or black leggings. Keep the jewelry minimal – maybe just a pair of small earrings. Flats or comfortable sandals would complete the look. A simple tote bag will be perfect for carrying your essentials.
