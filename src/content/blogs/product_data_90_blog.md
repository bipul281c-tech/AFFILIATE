## Detailed Features

### Fabric & Comfort

The kurta is made from Rayon fabric. Rayon is known for being lightweight and breathable, which is *bahut zaroori* for Indian summers. It feels soft against the skin, so you can wear it all day without feeling itchy or uncomfortable. Think of it as that old, comfy t-shirt, but in a stylish kurta avatar!

### Design & Fit

The Naira cut is what makes this kurta stand out. It's designed to flatter your figure and give you a stylish silhouette. The print is subtle yet eye-catching, making it suitable for both casual and semi-formal occasions. Stitching quality bhi theek-thaak hai, especially considering the price.

### Size & Fit Guide

The kurta length is 42 inches, which falls around calf length for most women. I'd say it's true to size, but if you prefer a looser fit, consider sizing up. Check the size chart on Amazon India before ordering to be sure!

## Styling Tips / Kaise Style Karein?

This kurta is super versatile! Here are a few ideas on how to style it:

### Occasion 1: Office/College

For a simple and elegant look, pair this kurta with white leggings or palazzos. Add some minimal jewelry, like small earrings or a delicate necklace. Flats or simple sandals would complete the look. *Ekdum* comfortable and professional!

### Occasion 2: Festive/Party

To dress it up for a festive occasion, go for heavy jhumkas and some bangles. You can also add a colorful dupatta with some embroidery or embellishments. Heels or wedges would add some extra height and glam.
