### Design & Fit

The kurta features a straight fit design with a calf-length cut, making it versatile for various occasions. The embroidered and batik print adds a touch of ethnicity, perfect for festive vibes. The shoulder straps give it a modern twist. Stitching quality bhi kaafi achi hai, looking at the price point.
