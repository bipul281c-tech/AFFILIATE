Yeh kurta, with its chikankari work, looks way more expensive than it actually is. And at ₹449, it's a complete paisa vasool deal! Plus, COD available hai, so no tension if you prefer paying cash.

## Detailed Features: Tavasya Kurta – A Deep Dive

Let's get into the nitty-gritty of this beautiful kurta.

### Fabric & Comfort

The kurta is made of cotton, which is a blessing in the Indian summers. Yeh fabric skin-friendly hai, breathable hai, and trust me, non-itchy bhi hai. I hate it when kurtas feel rough against the skin, but this one feels kaafi soft. You can easily wear it all day without feeling uncomfortable.

### Design & Fit

The straight cut silhouette gives it a sleek and elegant look. The all-over delicate white thread embroidery in traditional motifs is just beautiful. The notch neckline adds a touch of sophistication. The stitching quality bhi kaafi achi hai for the price.

### Size & Fit Guide

The kurta is available in sizes XS to 4XL. According to the reviews, it's mostly true to size. But if you prefer a more relaxed fit, especially during the festive season when you might indulge in some extra sweets, maybe size up for comfort.
