## GoSriKi Chanderi Kurta Set: Ek Detailed Look

This kurta set is not just beautiful, but it's also *kaafi* practical. Let's dive into the details:

### Fabric & Comfort

The kurta set is made of Chanderi Cotton (100%). Yeh fabric Indian weather ke liye *perfect* hai. It's breathable, lightweight, and feels soft against the skin. Garmi mein bhi *comfortable* rahoge. The fabric feels skin-friendly and non-itchy, which is a big plus for all-day wear.

### Design & Fit

The kurta has a straight cut with a calf-length design. The solid beige color is elegant and versatile. Dupatta printed hai, which adds a touch of festivity. The 3/4 sleeves are practical for both work and celebrations. Stitching quality bhi achi hai - *kaafi* sturdy hai!

GoSriKi offers sizes from S to XXL. According to the size chart, S is 36 inches, M is 38 inches, L is 40 inches, XL is 42 inches, and XXL is 44 inches for the kurta. Pants are S-28 in, M-30 in , L-32 in, XL- 34 in , XXL- 36 in. I would say it's mostly true to size, but if you prefer a relaxed fit, consider sizing up.
