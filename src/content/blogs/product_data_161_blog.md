## Pistaa's Women's Viscose Kurti: A Detailed Look

Okay, so yeh kurti actually hai kaisi? Let's dive into the details.

### Fabric & Comfort: Pure Bliss!

The first thing that caught my eye was the material: viscose. Viscose is known for being super comfortable, especially in the Indian climate. Imagine wearing something that feels soft against your skin, is breathable even when it's hot outside, and doesn't cause any itching or irritation. Yeh kurti bilkul waisi hi hai! It's perfect for all-day wear, whether you're at work, college, or just running errands. The interlock stitching ensures that the seams are strong and won't come apart easily. Kaafi sturdy hai!

### Design & Fit: Relaxed and Stylish

This kurti has a relaxed fit, which means it's not too tight or too loose. It's just right for a comfortable and stylish look. The length is 30 inches, which is perfect for pairing with leggings, jeans, or even palazzos. The print is simple yet elegant, making it suitable for various occasions. The mandarin collar adds a touch of sophistication, and the fold-up sleeves give you the option to adjust the look according to your preference. The straight cut is flattering for all body types.

### Size & Fit Guide: Find Your Perfect Fit

Pistaa provides a detailed size chart, which is super helpful. Make sure you check it before ordering to ensure you get the right fit. Generally, the sizes are as follows:

*   X-Small= 36 (Inch)
*   Small= 38(Inch)

*   XL=44(Inch)
