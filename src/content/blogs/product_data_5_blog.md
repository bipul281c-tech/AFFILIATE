## Detailed Features of the GoSriKi Kurta Palazzo Set

This kurta palazzo set promises style and comfort without breaking the bank. Let's dive into the details:

### Fabric & Comfort

The kurta is made of Rayon Viscose (100% Rayon Viscose). Rayon Viscose feels *kaafi* soft and light on the skin. It's *breathable* for Indian summers, which is a big plus. This fabric drapes well and gives a nice flowy look. It's not itchy at all, so you can wear it all day long *aram se*.

### Design & Fit

The style is straight, which is always a classic and flattering silhouette. The kurta length is calf length, making it suitable for both casual and semi-formal occasions. Sleeves are 3/4th, offering a good balance between coverage and style. The V-neck design adds a touch of elegance. The print is vibrant and eye-catching – perfect for festive wear.
