## Pistaa's Floral Kurta: A Detailed Look

This kurta is not just another piece of clothing; it's a complete package of comfort and style. Let's dive deep into what makes it special.

### Fabric & Comfort: Pure Cotton Magic

The kurta is made of pure cotton. Imagine, garmi ke dinon mein bhi, you’ll feel comfortable and relaxed. This isn't that rough cotton that scratches your skin. It’s soft, breathable, and perfect for the Indian climate. Din bhar pehno, koi irritation nahi hogi. Trust me, I've tried it!

### Design & Fit: A-Line All the Way

The A-line cut is universally flattering. It flares out gently from the bust, giving you a relaxed yet stylish silhouette. Floral print is evergreen; it never goes out of fashion. The crochet trims add a touch of elegance, making it suitable for both casual and semi-formal occasions. Interlock stitching ensures that the kurta is kaafi sturdy hai and will last long.
