### Fabric & Comfort:

Viscose ek aisa fabric hai jo *kaafi* comfortable hota hai, especially Indian summers ke liye.  Yeh *skin-friendly* bhi hai, toh itching ki tension nahi.  It's *breathable*, which means you won't feel suffocated even if you wear it for long hours. Maine personally viscose try kiya hai and trust me, *dil se bol rahi hu*, it's a lifesaver in this heat!

### Design & Fit:

The kurta has a straight fit, which is universally flattering. Floral print *kaafi* trendy hai aajkal, aur yeh white colour pe *bahut hi pyara* lag raha hai. The stitching quality also seems decent from the pictures. The dupatta has a chanderi feel, which adds a touch of elegance.

### Size & Fit Guide:

Sizes S to XXL *available* hain, toh almost sabko fit ho jayega.  Generally, KLOSIA ke kapde *true to size* hote hain, but if you want a more relaxed fit, toh ek size up le sakte ho. Always check the size chart on Amazon India before ordering, *kyunki baad mein returns ki jhanjhat nahi chahiye*.

### Occasion 1: Office/College

For a simple office or college look, pair this kurta set with minimal jewelry – just a small pair of earrings will do.  Flats or simple sandals *perfect rahenge*. Keep the makeup minimal.

For a festive occasion or a party, you can dress it up with heavy jhumkas, heels, and bangles.  Experiment with dupatta draping styles to add a touch of glam. A bright lipstick and a bindi will complete the look.

### Footwear:

*Kolhapuris* are a classic choice with ethnic wear. *Juttis* also look very stylish. If you want to add some height, go for block heels.

## Care Instructions / *Kapde Ki Dekhbhale*

Viscose *kaafi* delicate hota hai, toh *dekhbhaal karna zaroori hai*.

*   Hand wash is always the best option. If you use a machine, use a gentle cycle.
*   Don't dry it in direct sunlight, *warna colour fade ho jayega*.
*   Iron it on low heat. It's best to iron it when it's slightly damp.
