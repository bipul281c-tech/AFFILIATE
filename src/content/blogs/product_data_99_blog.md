Okay, so now let’s talk about styling. This kurti is super versatile!

### Occasion 1: Office/College

For a simple office look, pair this kurti with straight-fit leggings or cotton pants. Keep the jewelry minimal – maybe just small earrings and a watch. Flats or comfortable sandals will complete the look. You can also add a light cotton scarf if you want.

### Occasion 2: Festive/Party

### Footwear

For everyday wear, Kolhapuris or simple juttis are perfect. For a dressier occasion, opt for heels or wedges. Make sure your footwear is comfortable, especially if you'll be on your feet for a long time.

Silver jewelry goes really well with the rust color. Consider adding a statement necklace or a chunky bracelet for a festive look. A simple tote bag or a sling bag will complete your outfit.
