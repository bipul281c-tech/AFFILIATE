## Detailed Features: Aahwan Kurti Top

Yeh kurti sirf dikhne mein hi achi nahi hai, balki iske features bhi kaafi impressive hain. Let's dive into the details:

### Fabric & Comfort

The kurti is made of polyester, which makes it lightweight and easy to maintain. Polyester kaafi skin-friendly bhi hota hai, so you don't have to worry about any irritation, even in Indian summers. Although it's polyester, the material feels pretty breathable.

### Design & Fit

Is kurti ka design Indo-Western fusion hai. The square neck and backless design give it a modern touch, while the printed pattern adds an ethnic vibe. The slim fit and fit & flare cut accentuate your figure. Stitching quality bhi kaafi achi hai, considering the price point. It features a ruched bust and tie-back closure.
