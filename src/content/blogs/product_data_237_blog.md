### Festive/Party Look

To dress it up for a festive gathering or a party, go for heavy jhumkas and bangles. Heels will add height and make you look more graceful. You can experiment with dupatta draping styles to create different looks. Don't be afraid to go bold with your makeup – think smoky eyes and a bright lip. A clutch or a small embellished bag will be the perfect accessory.
