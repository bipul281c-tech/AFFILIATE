Aaj main aapke saath share kar rahi hoon GoSriKi Women's Ethnic Co-Ord Set ka review. This kurta palazzo set is perfect for festive wear or even casual outings. Aur sabse achi baat? It's super affordable! You can even get cash on delivery (COD available) if that's your preference. Let's dive into the details, because this Amazon find might just be the perfect addition to your wardrobe.

## Detailed Features of the GoSriKi Kurta Palazzo Set

This isn't just another kurta set; it's a complete look at a budget-friendly price. Let's break down what makes this GoSriKi set a great option for online shopping India.

### Fabric & Comfort

The kurta set fabric is Rayon Viscose (Rayon Viscose 100%). Ab, rayon viscose sunne mein thoda fancy lagta hai, but basically, it's super soft and comfortable. Think of it as a more breathable and skin-friendly fabric for Indian summers. It drapes well and feels non-itchy, which is a big plus. Even though it's not pure cotton, it will keep you comfortable.

### Design & Fit

The style is Anarkali, which is always a classic and flattering choice. The length is calf length, making it versatile enough for both casual and slightly dressier occasions. Sleeves are sleeveless, which is perfect for hot weather or layering with a jacket or shrug. The work is printed, adding a touch of elegance without being too over-the-top. The neck style is a boat neck, which is modern and chic.

### Size & Fit Guide

It's always tricky buying clothes online, right? Here's the size chart provided:

*   Kurta: S-36 in, M-38 in , L-40 in , XL-42 in , XXL-44 in
*   Pant :- S-28 in, M-30 in , L-32 in, XL- 34 in , XXL- 36 in

My advice? I would suggest to size up for comfort. Ethnic wear looks best when it's not too tight, especially during festivals when you want to be comfortable while eating all those sweets!
