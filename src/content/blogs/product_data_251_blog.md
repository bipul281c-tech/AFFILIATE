## Detailed Features: Kya Hai Is Kurti Mein Khaas?

### Fabric & Comfort: Pure Sukoon!

Yeh kurti rayon fabric se bani hai, which is perfect for Indian weather. Garmi mein bhi kaafi breathable rahegi. Maine khud try ki toh pata chala, skin-friendly bhi hai, bilkul itchy nahi lagti. Rayon is known for its smooth texture, toh pehenne mein bahut aaramdayak hai.

### Design & Fit: Stylish Aur Comfortable!

The kurta has a straight cut, which is universally flattering. The embroidery work is delicate and adds a touch of elegance. Stitching bhi kaafi sturdy hai, matlab yeh nahi ki ek dhulai mein hi nikal jaye! It’s designed keeping in mind contemporary casual fashion.
