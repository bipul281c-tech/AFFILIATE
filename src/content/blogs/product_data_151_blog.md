## EthnicJunction Kurta: Detailed Features

Let's talk about why this kurta is a steal. Yeh sirf dikhne mein hi sundar nahi hai, but the fabric and design bhi kaafi achhe hai.

### Fabric & Comfort

The kurta is made from a cotton blend, which makes it breathable especially for Indian summers. The fabric feels skin-friendly, so you won't feel itchy or uncomfortable even if you wear it for long hours. Believe me, comfort is key, especially during festivals when you're running around doing so many things.

This straight kurta has a high neck and 3/4 sleeves, giving it a very elegant and modern look. The embroidery is subtle but adds a touch of traditional charm. The stitching quality looks kaafi sturdy hai, which means it will last long. The knee-length design makes it versatile – you can wear it with leggings, jeans, or even a skirt.

## Kaise Style Karein? Styling Tips

This kurta is so versatile, you can style it in so many ways!

### Office/College Look

### Festive/Party Look

To dress it up for a festive occasion or a party, go for heavy jhumkas and a statement necklace. You can also add a colorful dupatta to enhance the look. Wear heels or embellished juttis. A clutch or a small embellished bag will be perfect.
