## Aahwan Printed Square Neck Kurti: Detailed Features

Okay, so pehle toh let's talk about the basics. Yeh kurti Indo-Western style mein hai, which means you can pair it with jeans, skirts, or even palazzos. The square neck and backless design give it a modern touch, while the print keeps it ethnic.

### Fabric & Comfort

The material is polyester. Now, I know what you're thinking – polyester in Indian summers? But hear me out! A good quality polyester can be surprisingly breathable. This one seems kaafi *skin-friendly* in the images, and perfect for *online shopping India* where you can't physically feel the fabric.

### Design & Fit

The kurti has a slim fit, so agar aapko thoda loose fit pasand hai, maybe size up karna better rahega. The print is vibrant and eye-catching, and the ruched bust adds a nice detail.

### Size & Fit Guide

The model is 5'7" and wearing a size S. So, I'd say it's pretty *true to size*. But, just to be safe, check the size chart on Amazon before you *buy online India*, especially if you prefer a more relaxed fit.

## Styling Tips / Kaise Style Karein?

This kurti is super versatile! Here are a couple of ways you can style it:
