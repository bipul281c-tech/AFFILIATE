## EthnicJunction Kurta: A Deep Dive into Features

Yeh kurta sirf dikhne mein hi sundar nahi hai, balki iske features bhi kaafi impressive hain. Let's break it down:

### Fabric & Comfort

The kurta is made of rayon, which is known for being a lightweight and breathable fabric. Garmi ke mausam mein, especially in India, rayon is a lifesaver! It feels soft against the skin, non-itchy, and allows air to circulate freely, keeping you comfortable all day long. Rayon is skin-friendly bhi hai, so you don't have to worry about any irritation.

### Design & Fit

This is a straight-style kurta with a knee-length cut, making it versatile for different occasions. The embroidered pattern adds a touch of elegance, perfect for festive wear India mein. The shoulder strap design is modern and stylish, while still maintaining an ethnic vibe. Stitching quality bhi achi hai, considering the price.

The size chart mentions measurements for M size. Generally, rayon kurtas are true to size. But, if you prefer a slightly looser fit, especially during festive occasions when you might be indulging in sweets, consider sizing up for comfort. Check the size chart carefully before placing your order on Amazon India.
