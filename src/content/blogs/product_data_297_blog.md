## Detailed Features: Pistaa Kurti – A Deep Dive

Yeh kurti sirf dikhne mein achi nahi hai, ismein kaafi kuch hai jo ise special banata hai. Let's break it down:

### Fabric & Comfort

The kurti is made of cotton, which is super important, especially for Indian weather. Cotton is known for being skin-friendly and breathable, so you won't feel itchy or uncomfortable, even if you wear it all day. Garmi mein bhi yeh kaafi comfortable rahega. The interlock stitching ensures the fabric is sturdy.

### Design & Fit

Yeh ek relaxed fit kurti hai, matlab it's not too tight or too loose. It has a flare style, which gives it a modern and stylish look. The embroidery adds a touch of elegance, making it suitable for both casual and semi-formal occasions. The mandarin collar gives it a classy touch. Sleeves are foldable, so you can adjust them according to your preference.

### Size & Fit Guide

It's crucial to get the right size, nahin toh paisa barbaad! Pistaa offers a wide range of sizes, from X-Small (36 inches) to XXXXL (50 inches). Make sure to check the size chart before ordering. Generally, the fit is as expected, but if you prefer a looser fit, you might consider sizing up.
