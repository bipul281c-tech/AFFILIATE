## Design & Fit: Details Matter

This kurta has a straight style and a knee-length cut. The mustard color is quite vibrant and festive. The high neck design adds a touch of elegance. Embroidered pattern is a nice touch; it's not too loud, but it definitely makes the kurta stand out. Stitching bhi kaafi fine hai, dekh ke lagta hai ki kaafi sturdy hai.

## Size & Fit Guide: Apne Size Ka Chuno!

The product details mention a size chart, so make sure to refer to that before ordering. Generally, straight kurtas are true to size, but if you prefer a looser fit, you might want to size up. Bust size aur shoulder measurements carefully check karna, especially if you are ordering online. Amazon India has an easy return policy in case of size issues, so that’s a relief!

## Styling Tips / Kaise Style Karein?

This kurta is super versatile. You can dress it up or down depending on the occasion.

### Office/College Look: Simple and Chic

For a simple office or college look, pair this kurta with leggings or palazzos. Keep the jewelry minimal – maybe just a pair of small earrings. Flats or simple sandals would be perfect. A tote bag will complete the look.

### Festive/Party Look: Dhamakedar!

For a festive or party look, go all out! Wear it with a contrasting dupatta. Heavy jhumkas and bangles will add a touch of glamour. High heels or embellished juttis would be ideal. You can also add a belt to cinch the waist and give the kurta a more defined shape.
