## Detailed Features: Kya Hai Is Kurti Mein Khaas?

### Fabric & Comfort

Yeh kurti polyester se bani hai, jo ki kaafi *skin-friendly* hai. Although polyester might not be your first choice for Indian summers, the sleeveless design makes it *breathable*. Plus, the material is lightweight, so it won't feel heavy even if you're wearing it for long hours. Mujhe toh yeh *non-itchy* bhi laga, which is a big plus!

### Design & Fit

The Aahwan kurti features a trendy square neck and a backless design with a drawstring closure. The printed pattern adds a touch of elegance, making it suitable for both casual and festive occasions. The *slim fit* style is flattering, highlighting your silhouette without being too restrictive. The *fit and flare* cut is super stylish.

### Size & Fit Guide

The model in the pictures is 5'7" and wearing a size S. From what I can tell, it seems *true to size*. However, if you prefer a more relaxed fit, you might want to *size up for comfort*. Always check the size chart on *Amazon India* before placing your order to ensure the perfect fit.
