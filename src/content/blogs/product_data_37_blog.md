## Styling Tips / Kaise Style Karein?

This kurta set is super versatile! Yahan kuch ideas hain to style this set:

### Occasion 1: Office/College

For a simple and elegant office or college look, pair the kurta set with minimal jewelry. Think small earrings and a simple bracelet. Flats or comfortable sandals would be perfect. Keep the dupatta neatly draped on one shoulder. A simple tote bag will complete the look.
