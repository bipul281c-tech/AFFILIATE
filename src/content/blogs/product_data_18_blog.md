### Design & Fit

The Jaipuri print is vibrant and eye-catching. The intricate block prints are so pretty, and the short length makes it super versatile. The stitching quality looks kaafi sturdy hai, so you know it's going to last. It's a classic design with a modern twist, perfect for both casual and semi-formal occasions.

### Size & Fit Guide

The kurti is available in sizes XS to 3XL. Make sure to check the size chart before ordering. Generally, it's true to size, but if you want a more relaxed fit, maybe size up for comfort. It's always better to have a little extra room, right?

## Styling Tips / Kaise Style Karein?

This kurti is super versatile! Here are a couple of ways you can style it:

### Occasion 1: Office/College

For a simple and elegant look, pair the kurti with leggings or palazzos. Keep the jewelry minimal – maybe just some small earrings. Flats or sandals will complete the look. It's perfect for a day at the office or college when you want to look put-together but still feel comfortable.

### Occasion 2: Festive/Party

Want to dress it up? Go for some heavy jhumkas and a statement necklace. High heels or embellished juttis will add a touch of glam. You can even drape a dupatta for a more traditional look. This kurti can easily transition from day to night with the right accessories.

### Footwear

Consider pairing this kurti with Kolhapuris for a traditional Indian look. Juttis are also a great option. If you want to add some height, go for wedges or block heels. Avoid stilettos as they might not complement the ethnic vibe.

Accessorize with silver or oxidized jewelry for a bohemian look. A sling bag or a tote bag will complete the outfit. Don't be afraid to experiment with different colors and textures.
