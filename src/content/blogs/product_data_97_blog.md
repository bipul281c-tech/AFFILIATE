## EthnicJunction Women's Kurti: A Detailed Look

Yeh kurti, specifically, is a rust-colored, viscose rayon A-line kurti with embroidery. The fabric seemed decent in the pictures, and the price was definitely right. Let's dive into the details, shall we?

### Fabric & Comfort

Viscose rayon hai, toh naturally, it's quite soft. Garmiyon ke liye *breathable* bhi rahega. I was a little worried about the color bleeding after the first wash, but so far, so good. The fabric feels skin-friendly, which is important, especially if you're wearing it for long hours. Achi baat yeh hai ki *non-itchy* bhi hai!

### Design & Fit

The A-line cut is quite flattering, and the embroidery adds a touch of elegance. It’s not too heavy, so it's perfect for both office wear and casual outings. Stitching quality bhi theek-thaak hai, considering the price. The length is above the knee, making it a *short kurti for women*, which is trendy these days.
