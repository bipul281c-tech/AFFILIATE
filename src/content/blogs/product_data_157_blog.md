## Detailed Features of the BIBA Rayon Kurta

Let's talk about the nitty-gritty details, kyunki sirf dekhne mein achha nahi hona chahiye, pehenne mein bhi comfortable hona chahiye!

### Fabric & Comfort

This kurta is made of rayon, which is super soft and breathable. Imagine, garmi mein bhi, you won't feel suffocated. It's skin-friendly, so no itching or irritation. Rayon is known for its drape and flow, making it look elegant without being too heavy. For online shopping India, comfort is key, and this kurta delivers!

### Design & Fit

The kurta has a straight fit, which is universally flattering. The lilac color is so soothing and trendy. It features a collar neck and 3/4th sleeves, making it perfect for both casual and semi-formal occasions. The print is subtle yet stylish, adding a touch of elegance without being too loud. The stitching quality looks kaafi sturdy hai, so I'm hoping it will last long.

### Size & Fit Guide

BIBA is generally true to size, but if you prefer a looser fit, especially in the summers, consider sizing up one size. Check the size chart on Amazon India before you [order yahan se](https://amzn.to/4pbaRGR).
