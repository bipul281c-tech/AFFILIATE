## Detailed Features: EthnicJunction Kurta

Let's talk about what makes this kurta a must-have for your wardrobe.

### Fabric & Comfort: Pure Bliss!

The kurta is made of a cotton blend, which makes it super skin-friendly. Garmi ke liye toh perfect hai! It's breathable, so you won't feel suffocated even if you wear it for long hours. Maine personally check kiya, material kaafi *kaafi* soft hai, non-itchy, and perfect for Indian summers.

This is a straight-fit kurta with beautiful embroidered and batik print detailing. The shoulder straps add a modern touch to the traditional design. Stitching quality bhi achi hai, which means it's *kaafi* sturdy and will last long. The calf-length is ideal for both casual and festive wear.
