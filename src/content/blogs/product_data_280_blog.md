## Detailed Features: Rajnandini Kurti - Ek Deep Dive

Let's get into the nitty-gritty, shall we?

### Fabric & Comfort: Pure Cotton ka Magic

This kurti is made of pure cambric cotton. Iska matlab hai, yeh skin-friendly hai aur Indian summers ke liye breathable bhi. The fabric feels soft against the skin, non-itchy, and is perfect for all-day wear. Garmi mein bhi aaram se nikal jayega! Cotton kurtis are always a great choice for comfort and style.

### Design & Fit: Jaipuri Print aur Straight Cut ka Combination

The Jaipuri print is what caught my eye first. It's not too loud, but it's definitely eye-catching. The navy blue and red color combination is classic and can be paired with almost anything. The straight cut is flattering for all body types and doesn't cling to the body. Stitching quality bhi kaafi achi hai for the price.

### Size & Fit Guide: Perfect Size Kaise Chunein?

The kurti is available in L size, with a bust size of 40, waist of 36, and hip of 42 inches. I would say it's true to size, but if you prefer a more relaxed fit, you might want to size up for comfort. Check the size chart carefully before you order, warna return karne mein pareshaani hogi.

## Styling Tips / Kaise Style Karein?

Yeh kurti versatile hai, so you can style it in so many ways!

### Occasion 1: Office/College - Simple and Chic

For office or college, keep it simple. Pair this kurti with leggings or straight pants. Minimal jewelry, like small earrings, and flats or sandals will complete the look. You can also add a simple cotton dupatta if you want.

### Occasion 2: Festive/Party - Dress it Up!

For a festive occasion or party, you can dress it up with heavy jhumkas, heels, and a colorful dupatta. Try draping the dupatta in different styles to add a touch of glamour. You can also wear it with a skirt or palazzo pants for a more festive look.
