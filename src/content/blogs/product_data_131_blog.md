### Fabric & Comfort

The viscose fabric feels *kaafi* soft and skin-friendly. It's breathable, so you won't feel suffocated even if you wear it for hours. Viscose is a good choice for the Indian climate, *kyunki* it allows air circulation. Garmi mein bhi *aramdayak*!

### Design & Fit

This is a straight kurta with a calf-length design. The 3/4 sleeves are practical and stylish. The round neck is simple yet elegant, making it suitable for both casual and festive occasions. The embroidery adds a touch of sophistication without being too overwhelming. Stitching quality bhi *acchi lagti hai*.

### Size & Fit Guide

The size chart is pretty accurate, but if you prefer a looser fit, consider sizing up. *Agar comfortable rehna hai toh*, one size up is always a good idea!

## Styling Tips / *Kaise Style Karein?*

This kurta set is versatile, *yaar*! You can style it in many ways depending on the occasion.

### Occasion 1: Office/College

For a simple office or college look, pair it with minimal jewelry like small earrings and a simple bracelet. Flats or *juttis* would be perfect for footwear. Keep the makeup minimal for a fresh, everyday look.

### Occasion 2: Festive/Party

To dress it up for a festive occasion or party, go for heavy *jhumkas* and heels. You can experiment with different dupatta draping styles to add a touch of glamour. A clutch or small *potli* bag would complete the look.
