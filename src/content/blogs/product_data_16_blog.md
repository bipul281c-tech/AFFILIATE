### Fabric & Comfort

Yeh kurti bani hai pre-shrunk cotton se. So, shrinkage ki tension nahi! The material is lightweight and feels soft to the skin. Imagine wearing something breathable, especially for Indian summers – *garmi mein aaram hi aaram!* It’s designed to be non-itchy, which is a big plus point for all-day comfort.

### Design & Fit

The design is very Jaipuri, with beautiful prints that give it a traditional yet modern look. The short length makes it versatile – you can pair it with leggings, jeans, or even a skirt. Stitching quality *kaafi* sturdy *hai*, so you know it won't fall apart after a few washes.
