**Detailed Features: Is Kurti mein Kya Hai Khaas?**

## Fabric & Comfort: Pure Cotton ka Ehsaas

The best part about this kurti is the fabric – it's cotton! Indian summers ke liye, nothing beats cotton. It's super breathable and *skin-friendly*. Maine pehen ke dekha, aur sach bataun toh, *non-itchy* bhi hai. No irritating fabric rubbing against your skin the whole day. Plus, cotton is a kaafi sturdy fabric, so you know it'll last.

## Design & Fit: Floral Magic

Yeh kurti floral print mein hai, which is always a classic. The V-neck design is flattering, and the 3/4 sleeves are perfect for any weather. Stitching quality bhi achi hai, especially considering the price. It's a simple yet elegant design that you can easily dress up or down.

## Size & Fit Guide: Perfect Size Kaise Chune?

MEERA FAB ne size chart provide kiya hai, which is super helpful. Basically, XS is 34 inches, S is 36 inches, M is 38 inches, L is 40 inches, XL is 42 inches, and XXL is 44 inches. I would say it's *true to size*, but if you want a more relaxed fit, maybe *size up for comfort*.
