## GoSriKi Kurta Pant Set: Detailed Features

This kurta set is a complete outfit, aur woh bhi *itne kam price mein*! Let's dive into the details:

### Fabric & Comfort

The kurta set is made from a cotton blend, which means it's breathable and comfortable, especially for Indian summers. Fabric skin-friendly bhi hai, toh itching ki koi tension nahi. This makes it kaafi sturdy for daily wear.

### Design & Fit

The kurta has a straight style and calf length, which is very much in trend right now. Sleeves 3/4th hai, perfect for both work and casual outings. The print is simple yet elegant, making it versatile enough to pair with different accessories.

### Size & Fit Guide

The size chart is mentioned clearly. Kurta sizes range from S (36 inches) to XXL (44 inches), and pant sizes range from S (28 inches) to XXL (36 inches). I would suggest checking the size chart carefully before ordering. Agar thoda loose fit pasand hai, toh size up for comfort.
