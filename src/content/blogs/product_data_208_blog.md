## Detailed Features: Myx Kurta Mein Kya Hai Khaas?

Let’s take a closer look at what makes this kurta a potential steal.

### Fabric & Comfort: Pure Cotton ka Ehsaas
Yeh kurta pure cotton cambric se bana hai, which is perfect for Indian summers. Fabric non-sheer hai, toh you don't have to worry about it being see-through. Aur sabse achi baat, ismein ek special softener finish hai, jo skin pe kaafi smooth feel deta hai. Imagine wearing something that feels like a gentle hug – bilkul waisa hi! Garmi mein bhi yeh breathable rahega, so no more itchy, uncomfortable days.

### Design & Fit: Regular Fit, Perfect for Everyday Wear
The Myx kurta has a regular fit and comes down to calf length. Iska matlab hai ki yeh zyada tight bhi nahi hai aur zyada loose bhi nahi – bilkul perfect for everyday wear. The all-over screen print adds a touch of elegance, aur 3/4th sleeves are practical. Band collar with a full-length placket is a classic design element that never goes out of style. Stitching quality bhi kaafi sturdy hai, dekh ke lagta hai ki yeh kurta kaafi time tak chalega.

### Size & Fit Guide: Apna Perfect Size Kaise Dhunde?
Amazon ke catalogue mein 5th image mein detailed size chart diya gaya hai. Make sure to check it out before ordering. Generally, Myx clothing true to size hota hai, but agar aapko thoda loose fit pasand hai, toh consider sizing up for comfort.
