## Detailed Features of the Sun Fashion Chanderi Kurti

Let's dive deep into what makes this kurti stand out.

### Fabric & Comfort

The kurti is made of Chanderi fabric. Chanderi is known for its lightweight and slightly sheer texture. Garmi ke liye toh ekdum perfect! It's not too heavy, so it's breathable for Indian summers. Though it's not the softest fabric in the world, it *is* skin-friendly and shouldn't cause any itching or irritation.

### Design & Fit

This is a straight kurti with side slits, which gives it a modern yet traditional look. The calf length is ideal – not too short, not too long. The floral print is subtle and elegant, making it suitable for various occasions. The elbow sleeves are a practical choice, especially if you're constantly working or on the go. Stitching quality wise, it seems decent for the price point.

### Size & Fit Guide

Sun Fashion provides sizes ranging from XS (34 inches) to 2XL (44 inches). According to some reviews, it's best to check the size chart carefully before ordering. If you prefer a more relaxed fit, consider sizing up. Generally, it seems true to size, but *thoda* loose fit *hamesha* comfortable *hi hota hai*.
