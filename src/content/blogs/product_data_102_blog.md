## EthnicJunction Kurti: Detailed Features

Yeh kurti sirf dikhne mein hi achi nahi hai, iske features bhi kaafi impressive hain. Let's dive in!

### Fabric & Comfort

The kurta fabric is Viscose Rayon, which is supremely soft. Imagine, Indian summers mein bhi yeh breathable rahegi! Skin-friendly material hai, toh itching ki tension nahi. Kaafi comfortable hai, especially agar aap office ke liye daily wear dhoondh rahe ho. Yeh kaafi *sturdy* bhi hai.

### Design & Fit

This is an A-line kurti, which is flattering for most body types. The rust color with embroidery gives it a very ethnic yet modern look. Stitching quality bhi achi hai, so you know it will last. The neckline is round, and the product length is above the knee. Perfect for those who prefer shorter kurtis. It's a regular fit top.

### Size & Fit Guide

The size chart says that 'L' size has Across Shoulder (Inches) - 15, Bust - 38, chest - 38, Front length - 28, waist - 37, Hips - 44. I would say it's true to size. Agar aapko thoda loose fit pasand hai, toh consider sizing up for extra comfort. Refer to the size chart on Amazon India before ordering online shopping India mein hamesha ek size chart dekhna chahiye.

## Styling Tips / Kaise Style Karein?

Yeh kurti versatile hai! Aap isko alag-alag occasions ke liye style kar sakte hain.

### Office/College Look

For a simple office or college look, pair this kurti with plain leggings or palazzos. Minimal jewelry, like small earrings, would be perfect. Footwear mein flats ya simple sandals achi lagegi. Keep it simple and classy.

### Festive/Party Look

Agar festive occasion hai, toh is kurti ko heavy jhumkas, heels, aur ek beautiful dupatta ke saath dress up karein. You can also add a belt to cinch the waist. Kolhapuri chappals or juttis will look great for a traditional touch.
