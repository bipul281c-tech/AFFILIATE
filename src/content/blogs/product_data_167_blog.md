### Design & Fit: Flattering and Elegant

The all-over floral print in pastel hues is so elegant. It's not too loud, but it's definitely eye-catching. The A-line silhouette is universally flattering, enhancing your figure without feeling too tight. Stitching quality bhi kaafi sturdy hai, which means it'll last you a good while. The midi-length adds a touch of sophistication, making it suitable for various occasions.

### Unique Detailing: Pom-Pom Power

The V-neckline with pom-pom button detailing adds a handcrafted touch. It's a small detail, but it makes a big difference. It sets this kurta apart from other printed dresses and gives it a unique, playful vibe.
