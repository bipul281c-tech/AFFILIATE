## Fabric & Comfort: Pure Cotton Bliss!

Yeh kurti bani hai cotton se, toh obviously, *kaafi* comfortable hogi. Especially Indian summers ke liye, cotton is a lifesaver. I can imagine wearing this all day without feeling itchy or suffocated. Plus, the relaxed fit means you won't feel restricted, which is a major plus point. They say it has interlock stitching, which means *kaafi* sturdy bhi hogi.

## Design & Fit: Simple yet Elegant

The design is simple, but the embroidery adds a touch of elegance. It's a short, flare-style kurti with a mandarin collar and fold-up sleeves. The length is 30 inches, which is perfect for wearing with jeans, leggings, or even palazzos. The flare style gives it a modern twist, making it suitable for both casual and semi-formal occasions.

## Size & Fit Guide: Find Your Perfect Fit

Okay, sizing is important! Pistaa has provided a detailed size chart:

*   X-Small= 36 (Inch)
*   Small= 38(Inch)
*   Medium=40(Inch)
*   Large=42(Inch)
*   XL=44(Inch)
*   XXL=46(Inch)
*   XXXL=48(Inch)
*   XXXXL=50(Inch)

Make sure to measure yourself before ordering! *Agar aapko thoda loose fit pasand hai*, then maybe size up. It's always better to have a little extra room than to feel squeezed in.
