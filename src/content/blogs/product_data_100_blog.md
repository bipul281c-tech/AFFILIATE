## Fabric & Comfort: Garmi Mein Bhi Cool Raho!

Yeh kurti viscose rayon se bani hai, which means it's super soft and breathable. Imagine, Indian summers mein bhi you won't feel suffocated. Maine personally check kiya hai, material skin-friendly hai, non-itchy hai, so you can wear it all day long without any discomfort.
