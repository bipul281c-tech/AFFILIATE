## Detailed Features of the Yash Gallery Cotton Patch Work Top

This top is all about comfort and style without breaking the bank. Let's dive into the details:

The top is made of cotton, which is a big plus for Indian weather. Imagine, the scorching sun is blazing down, and you are in this top. You will feel comfortable, and the fabric is skin-friendly.

### Design & Fit: Simple But Stylish

The design is simple, a straight cut that looks good on almost everyone. It's a patch work pattern, which gives it a unique and थोड़ा सा ethnic vibe. The stitching quality seems decent for the price. It's a western style top, so it's easy to pair with jeans or leggings.

### Size & Fit Guide: Apne Size Ka Dhyaan Rakhein!

The product description says to check your measurements before ordering. This is super important! Select the correct size from the dropdown menu. I'd say it's mostly true to size, but if you prefer a more relaxed fit, consider sizing up. Size chart definitely refer karna, warna baad mein problem ho jayegi!
