## Detailed Features - Kyun Yeh Kurta Hai Best?

Okay, let's get into the details. Yeh kurta sirf dikhne mein achha nahi hai, isme kaafi kuch hai jo ise ek smart buy banata hai.

### Fabric & Comfort

The kurta is made of pure cotton. Garmi ke liye perfect! The material feels skin-friendly aur breathable hai, jo Indian summers ke liye bahut zaroori hai. No itchy feeling, just pure comfort all day long. Material *kaafi* sturdy *hai*, so it will last long.

### Design & Fit

It's an A-line kurta with a relaxed fit, so it's super comfortable and flattering for all body types. The floral print is vibrant and eye-catching, perfect for festive wear India. The 3/4th sleeves are practical, and the round collar style is simple yet elegant. Crochet trims add a touch of sophistication. Kurti Length is 46 Inch.

### Size & Fit Guide

Pistaa provides a detailed size chart. It's important to confirm your size before ordering. Basically, X-Small= 36 (Inch), Small= 38(Inch), Medium=40(Inch), Large=42(Inch), XL=44(Inch), XXL=46(Inch),XXXL=48(Inch), XXXXL=50(Inch). I would say it’s true to size, but if you want a more relaxed fit, size up for comfort.
