## Detailed Features of the ANNI DESIGNER Kurta Set

### Fabric & Comfort

Yeh kurta set rayon blend fabric se bana hai (Rayon 90% aur Cotton 10%). Rayon blend kaafi comfortable hota hai, especially for Indian summers. It's lightweight and breathable, meaning aapko garmi mein paseena nahi aayega. Aur cotton blend hone ki wajah se, yeh skin-friendly bhi hai. Material kaafi sturdy hai for the price.

### Design & Fit

The kurta is Anarkali style, which is always a hit during festive seasons. Length calf length tak hai, jo ki kaafi decent hai. Sleeves 3/4th hai, so it's perfect for wearing both indoors and outdoors. Neck style V-neck hai, giving it a modern touch. Print bhi kaafi vibrant hai. Overall, design wise, it's a pretty good option.

### Size & Fit Guide

Size chart mein Kurta sizes S-36 in, M-38 in, L-40 in, XL-42 in, aur XXL-44 in diye gaye hain. Pant sizes S-28 in, M-30 in, L-32 in, XL- 34 in, aur XXL-36 in hain. I would say it's mostly true to size, but agar aapko comfortable fit chahiye, toh ek size up le sakte hain. Always check the size chart before you buy online India, kyunki har brand ka sizing alag hota hai.
