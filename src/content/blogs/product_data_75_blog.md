## Detailed Features of the Yash Gallery Kurti

### Fabric & Comfort

Yeh kurti polyester se bani hai, which means yeh kaafi lightweight aur easy to maintain hai. Indian summers ke liye, aisa fabric bilkul perfect rehta hai. It's not cotton, so it won't be as breathable, but for the price, it's a paisa vasool deal. The material is skin-friendly, so you won't have to worry about any irritation.

The keyhole neck adds a touch of elegance. Floral print design is evergreen and looks good for both casual and festive occasions. Stitching quality bhi theek-thaak hai, considering the price point.
