## Fabric aur Comfort: Garmi mein bhi sukoon!

This Myx kurti is made of pure cotton cambric. Ab, cotton cambric matlab *kaafi* soft aur breathable. They’ve also given it a special softener finish, so it feels smooth against your skin. Garmi ke liye ekdum perfect! It won't be itchy or irritating, even if you wear it all day. Imagine, *kitna sukoon milega* in those hot Indian summers!

## Design aur Fit: Simple lekin Stylish

The kurti has a regular fit, which means it's not too tight or too loose. It's a short kurti with a band collar and a half placket – very modern and chic. The 3/4th sleeves have roll-up tabs, so you can adjust them according to your comfort. The screen print is subtle but stylish. The stitching quality looks *kaafi* sturdy hai, so it should last long.

## Size & Fit Guide: Apne liye Perfect Size Kaise Chune?

Myx recommends referring to the 5th image in their catalogue for a detailed size chart. Make sure you measure yourself properly before ordering. Generally, cotton kurtis can shrink a little after the first wash, so maybe consider sizing up if you prefer a looser fit. Always check the size chart on Amazon India, because sizes can vary between brands.
