### Design & Fit: Stylish Aur Comfortable

The kurti has an A-line style and a short length, which makes it perfect to pair with jeans, leggings, or even a skirt. The 3/4 sleeves are ideal for both office and casual outings. But the real star is the beautiful neck embroidery. It adds that extra touch of elegance without being too loud. Stitching bhi kaafi neat hai, which is a big plus point.

### Size & Fit Guide: Fit Hai Toh Hit Hai!

From what I can tell from the reviews, the kurti seems to be true to size. Lekin agar aapko thoda loose fit pasand hai, toh maybe size up for extra comfort. Check the size chart on Amazon India before you [order yahan se](https://amzn.to/4ooy4E4), just to be sure!
