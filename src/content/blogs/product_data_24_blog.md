## A Deep Dive into the Features

### Fabric & Comfort
The fabric is pure cotton cambric, which means it's super *skin-friendly* and *breathable* – perfect for Indian summers. The special softener finish gives it a smooth feel, so it's *non-itchy* and comfortable to wear all day long. Imagine wearing something that feels like a gentle hug – that's this kurti!

### Design & Fit
This is a regular fit, short kurti with a contemporary twist. The screen-printed design is eye-catching without being too loud. The band collar with a half placket adds a touch of sophistication, while the 3/4th sleeves with roll-tab cuffs give it a modern vibe. The stitching quality is *kaafi sturdy hai*, which means it'll last you a long time.

### Size & Fit Guide
My advice? Check the size chart carefully before you order. It seems to be *true to size*, but if you want a looser, more comfortable fit, consider sizing up. The product description also mentions referring to the 5th image for a detailed size guide, so definitely check that out!
