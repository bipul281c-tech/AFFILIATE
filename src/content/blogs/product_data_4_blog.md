### Design & Fit

This BIBA kurta features a simple yet elegant straight cut. The turmeric yellow color is vibrant and festive, perfect for adding a pop of color to your wardrobe. The V-neck design is flattering, and the 3/4th sleeves are practical. Stitching quality bhi achhi hai, which means it's kaafi sturdy hai.

### Size & Fit Guide

BIBA is generally true to size, but if you prefer a looser fit, especially in cotton kurtas, consider sizing up. Measuring yourself before ordering is always a good idea. Amazon India has a detailed size chart available on the product page.

## Styling Tips / Kaise Style Karein?

This kurta is super versatile! You can style it in so many ways.

### Occasion 1: Office/College

For a simple office or college look, pair this kurta with white or beige leggings or palazzos. Keep the jewelry minimal – just a simple pendant or small earrings. Flat sandals or juttis would complete the look. This is a no-fuss, comfortable yet stylish option.

### Occasion 2: Festive/Party

To dress it up for a festive occasion, go for heavy jhumkas, a statement necklace, and some bangles. You can also add a contrasting dupatta with zari work. Heels or embellished Kolhapuris would look great. A clutch or a small potli bag would complete the festive look.
