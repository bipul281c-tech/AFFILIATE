## Detailed Features of This Budget-Friendly Kurti

### Fabric & Comfort

The kurti is made from rayon fabric. Rayon is known for being lightweight and breathable, perfect for Indian summers. Yeh *skin-friendly* bhi hai, toh itching ka koi chance nahi. Trust me, I've worn it all day, and it's *kaafi* comfortable.

### Design & Fit

The straight cut design is flattering for most body types. The embroidery on the top adds a touch of elegance without being too over-the-top. Stitching quality bhi mujhe achi lagi. It seems *kaafi sturdy hai* for the price.

### Size & Fit Guide

From what I can tell, the sizing is true to size. Agar aapko thoda loose fit pasand hai, toh maybe size up for comfort. Amazon India has a good return policy, so if it doesn't fit perfectly, you can always exchange it.
