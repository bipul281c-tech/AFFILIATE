## Detailed Features - Stylum Kurta Kya Hai?

Okay, so let's break down exactly what makes this kurta a good choice for *online shopping India*:

### Fabric & Comfort

The kurta is made of rayon fabric. Rayon is known for being lightweight and breathable, which is super important for Indian weather. Imagine wearing something that feels *skin-friendly* and doesn't make you sweat instantly! This rayon is *kaafi* soft and comfortable, perfect for long hours of festive celebrations or even a day at the office. Garmi mein bhi aaram deh rahega.

### Design & Fit

The beige color with gold print gives it a festive yet elegant look. The lace detailing adds a touch of sophistication. It's a straight kurta with a below-knee length (45 inches), which is a classic and flattering style for most body types. Round neck and 3/4 sleeves are always a safe and stylish bet. The print is all over, so it's not too overwhelming but definitely makes a statement.

### Size & Fit Guide

It's available in plus sizes, including 5XL. While some reviews suggest it might run a little tight, it's always a good idea to check the size chart carefully before ordering. If you're unsure, consider sizing up for extra comfort. Remember, *comfort is key*, especially during festivals!
